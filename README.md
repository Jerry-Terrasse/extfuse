# Extension Framework for FUSE

We have modifed the FUSE driver to support ExtFUSE feature. Therefore, you will have to install and run a our modified kernel. To clone the kernel sources do:
```
$ git clone --branch ExtFUSE-1.0 https://github.com/extfuse/linux 
$ cd linux
$ make menuconfig
--> General setup
	[*] Enable bpf() system call
--> File systems  
	<*> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support                                                                                                                                       
	[*]   Extension framework for FUSE
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install -j4
$ make headers_install
```
In menuconfig step, **DO NOT** select FUSE as a kernel module as it will cause the kernel compilation to fail; instead, build FUSE into the kernel.

Boot into the new kernel. Clone ExtFUSE library sources and build. Export the path to repo as EXTFUSE_REPO_PATH. You will need LLVM/Clang toolchain to build.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/extfuse/extfuse
$ cd extfuse
$ export EXTFUSE_REPO_PATH=$(pwd)
$ LLC=llc-3.8 CLANG=clang-3.8 make
```

The eBPF code for handling FUSE requests in the kernel can be found in ```bpf/extfuse.c```.
Once you build the library, compiled eBPF bytecode can be found in ```src/extfuse.o```.

Finally, you will also need a modified FUSE library. To clone its source repo:
```
$ git clone --branch ExtFUSE-1.0 https://github.com/extfuse/libfuse
```
Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/fuse_3_0_bugfix/README.md) to build libfuse. **NOTE** that you will need to run ```./makeconf.sh``` to create the ```configure``` script.

You can test ExtFUSE functionality with a simple stackable FUSE file system [here](https://github.com/ashishbijlani/StackFS). **NOTE** that you will need to copy ```$EXTFUSE_REPO_PATH/src/extfuse.o``` to ```/tmp``` before you test StackFS because the name and path is hard-coded in ```StackFS_LL.c```.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ashishbijlani/StackFS
$ cd StackFS
$ make
$ cp $EXTFUSE_REPO_PATH/bpf/extfuse.o /tmp/.
$ sudo sh -c "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$EXTFUSE_REPO_PATH ./StackFS_ll -o max_write=131072 -o writeback_cache -o splice_read -o splice_write -o splice_move -r $ROOT_DIR $MNT_DIR -o allow_other"
```
